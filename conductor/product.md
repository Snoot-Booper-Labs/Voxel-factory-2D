## Vision

A 2D factory automation game (Factorio-like) built in Godot, aimed at teaching programming concepts.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Automation**: Players build systems to automate tasks.
2.  **Programmability**: Success requires logic and possibly coding/visual scripting.
3.  **Exploration**: A procedurally generated world to explore and exploit.
